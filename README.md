### Chart Factory ###

Based on D3.JS and Dimple, ChartFactory provide the ability to build quickly D3.JS charts without coding any lines of javascript. Just define your dashboard in a JSON and voila !

As Dimple does, it expose the core d3 objects where possible so that as users gain confidence they can extend the base functionality in whatever way they wish.
